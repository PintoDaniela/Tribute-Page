                <h2>About Iroh</h2>
                <p>
                    Uncle Iroh, also known as General Iroh and referred to simply as Uncle, is a beloved fictional character in Nickelodeon's acclaimed animated television series Avatar: The Last Airbender. Created by Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko, the character was originally voiced by the late Mako in the first two seasons, and later by Greg Baldwin in the third season and the sequel series, The Legend of Korra.
                    <br>
                    In the episode "The Tales of Ba Sing Se", Iroh's name was written as 艾洛 (aì lùo) as a tribute to Mako, who had passed away months before the episode aired. The episode was dedicated "In Honor of Mako", highlighting the impact that he and his portrayal of Uncle Iroh had on the show's fans.

                    <i>A Backstory of Iroh's Life before The Last Airbender</i>
                </p>            
                <p>
                    Before the events of The Last Airbender, Iroh was the eldest son of Fire Lord Azulon. However, after his son Lu Ten died during the failed Fire Nation siege of Ba Sing Se, Iroh, who had always been motivated more by duty than personal ambition, retreated from military affairs. Despite having once envisioned himself capturing the city, he abandoned the siege following his son's death.
                    <br>
                    Iroh's younger brother, Ozai, was more ambitious and opportunistic. He attempted to convince their father that, due to Iroh's defeat and lack of heirs, Ozai should become the next Fire Lord instead of Iroh. But Azulon was outraged by this lack of respect for Iroh's position and ordered Ozai to kill his own son, Prince Zuko, as punishment. Ozai and his wife, Princess Ursa, conspired to assassinate Azulon instead, with Ursa accepting banishment for her role.
                    <br>
                    After Azulon's death, Iroh was mourning and disinterested in state affairs, allowing Ozai to seize the leadership of the Fire Nation. Although Iroh was believed to have killed the world's last dragons, he actually learned from the last two dragons, Ran and Shao, to derive his firebending powers from vitality rather than rage. He lied about killing the last of the dragons to end the Fire Nation tradition of dragon hunts. Iroh was also a high-ranking member (Grand Lotus) of the Order of the White Lotus, an international secret society.
